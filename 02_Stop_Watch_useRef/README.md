# Referencing Values with Refs

### How does useRef work inside?

Although both `useState` and `useRef` are provided by React, in principle `useRef` could be implemented on top of `useState`. You can imagine that inside of React, `useRef` is implemented like this:

```js
// Inside of React
function useRef(initialValue) {
  const [ref, unused] = useState({ current: initialValue });
  return ref;
}
```

During the first render, `useRef` returns `{ current: initialValue }`. This object is stored by React, so during the next render the same object will be returned. Note how the state setter is unused in this example. It is unnecessary because `useRef` always needs to return the same object!

React provides a built-in version of `useRef` because it is common enough in practice. But you can think of it as a regular state variable without a setter. If you’re familiar with object-oriented programming, refs might remind you of instance fields—but instead of `this.something` you write `somethingRef.current`.
